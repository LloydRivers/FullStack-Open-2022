/*
The ReturnType<T> utility type in TypeScript allows you to extract the return type from a function type T. It retrieves the type of the value that the function returns, whether it has an explicit return type annotation or not.

Here's an example to showcase the usage of ReturnType:
*/

// Define a function type
type MyFunction = () => number;

// Extract the return type from MyFunction
type MyFunctionReturn = ReturnType<MyFunction>;

// Usage example
const result: MyFunctionReturn = 42;

/*
In the code snippet above, we have a function type MyFunction that doesn't take any parameters and returns a value of type number. By using the ReturnType<MyFunction> utility type, we extract the return type from MyFunction and assign it to MyFunctionReturn, which becomes number.

The ReturnType utility type is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to capture the return type of a function dynamically, without manually duplicating the return type. It helps reduce type duplication, especially when working with third-party libraries or when mocking function responses.

In the example, we can use the MyFunctionReturn type to define a variable result that matches the return type of MyFunction. We can then assign a value of the corresponding type to result, ensuring type compatibility.

It's worth noting that ReturnType operates on function types and not on function declarations or expressions directly. Also, if a function has multiple return statements with different types, the inferred return type will be a union of those types.

The ReturnType utility type is particularly handy in scenarios where TypeScript may have difficulty inferring the return type, such as inside generators or when dealing with complex function invocations.
