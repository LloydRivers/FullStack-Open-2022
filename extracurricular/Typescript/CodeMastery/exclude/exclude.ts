// Define two union types: A and B
type A = "apple" | "banana" | "cherry" | "date";
type B = "banana" | "date" | "elderberry" | "fig";

// Exclude members from B that are also in A
type Difference = Exclude<B, A>;

// Usage example
const difference: Difference = "elderberry"; // Valid, as 'elderberry' is only present in B, not in A

/*
const invalid: Difference = 'banana'; // Invalid, as 'banana' is present in both A and B
*/

/*
In the code snippet above, we have two union types, A and B, representing sets of elements. We use the Exclude<B, A> utility type to create a new union type, Difference, that includes the elements from B which are not present in A.

By using Exclude, we can derive a union type that only contains the members unique to one of the original unions. In the example, Difference includes the element 'elderberry', which is present in B but not in A.

It's worth noting that Exclude provides the set difference in terms of type membership, not the exact values. So, if two unions have members with the same names but different types, those members will still be considered as part of the difference.

The Exclude utility type is useful when you need to manipulate and differentiate between union types, allowing you to create more refined type definitions in your code.
