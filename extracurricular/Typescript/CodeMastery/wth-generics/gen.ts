type ExcludeString<T> = T extends string ? never : T;
/*
type ExcludeString<T>: This is a type alias declaration. It defines a new type called ExcludeString that takes a generic type parameter T. The purpose of this type is to exclude the string type from the input type T.

T extends string ? never : T;: This is a conditional type expression. It utilizes the conditional operator (? :) to conditionally assign types based on a type check.

T extends string: This is the type check part of the conditional expression. It checks if the type T extends (or is assignable to) the string type. If this condition is true, the expression following the ? is used; otherwise, the expression following the : is used.

never: The never type is assigned when the condition T extends string is true. The never type represents values that can never occur. By assigning never, we effectively filter out the string type from the resulting type.

T: The type T is assigned when the condition T extends string is false. In other words, if T is not assignable to string, it will be assigned to T itself.

Here's an example usage to further illustrate the behavior:
*/

type NumberOrString = number | string;

type OnlyNumbers = ExcludeString<NumberOrString>; // Result: number
/*
In this example, we have a union type NumberOrString that includes both number and string. We want to create a new type OnlyNumbers that excludes the string type from the original union.

By applying the ExcludeString type alias with NumberOrString as the generic argument, the conditional type is evaluated as follows:

For number, number extends string is false, so it is assigned number.
For string, string extends string is true, so it is assigned never.
As a result, the OnlyNumbers type becomes a union of only the number type, effectively excluding the string type.

This syntax allows for conditional type manipulation, providing flexibility to customize types based on specific conditions or requirements in your code. It can be powerful when combined with other TypeScript features like union types, intersection types, and mapped types.
