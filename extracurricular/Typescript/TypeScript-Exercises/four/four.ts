Intro:

    As we introduced "type" to both User and Admin
    it's now easier to distinguish between them.
    Once object type checking logic was extracted
    into separate functions isUser and isAdmin -
    logPerson function got new type errors.

Exercise:

    Figure out how to help TypeScript understand types in
    this situation and apply necessary fixes.
