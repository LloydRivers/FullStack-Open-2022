# My TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and learning experiences as I explore TypeScript. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for others who are also learning or looking for TypeScript examples.

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript. It provides improved code organization, better tooling support, and enhanced error checking. If you're new to TypeScript, you can learn more about it in the official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
